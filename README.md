Getting Started:
		Prerequisites:
		1. Python3 by command "sudo apt-get install python3.6"
		2. Flask by command "pip install Flask"
		3. Pytest by command "pip install -U pytest"
		4. Tavern by command "pip install tavern[pytest]"
		5. Foreman by command "sudo gen install foreman"

Installing:
		1. Python3.6 was installed using the command "sudo apt-get install python3.6"
		2. Make python3 as the default verion using below commands:
			sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 1
			sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6 2
			sudo update-alternatives --config python
		3. Flask was installed using the command "pip install Flask"
		4. Pytest was installed using the command "pip install -U pytest"
		5. Tavern was installed using the command "pip install tavern[pytest]"
		6. Foreman was installed using the command command "sudo gen install foreman"

		

		
	Example of a test case:
	In the below example we will be validating the response that we get from the API against the 
	request that we send. We have to ensure the order of executing the test cases and proper data 
	should be provided in the request. 
	
	---
		test_name: List all articles for a new tag
		stages:
		- name: List all articles for a new tag
			request:
				url: http://localhost:5300/searchArticle/tag1
				method: GET
				headers:
					content-type: application/json
				response:
					status_code: 200
					body:
						[
							{
								"title": "project" 
							},
							{
								"title": "project new" 
							},
						]
           
	---

Deployment:
	The above written steps in Installation and running the test needs to be followed in order.
